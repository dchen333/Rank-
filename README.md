# Choose!-
A manual topological sort webapp to determine a top preference among many choices.

Choose! is a manual topological webapp implemented in Flask. It consists of a primary application.py with a templates folder including the necessary html files.

Once hosted on a webserver, simply follow the directions as given.

A brief summary of directions here:

Choose! uses a topological sort approach to determine a top preference out of many choices in qualitative decision-making. This is based on the concept that deciding between 2 choices at once is generally easier. While not a perfect mechanism, it helps quickly provide a single top choice, without requiring sample size or much preparation.

Simply enter a variety of choices you are deciding among into the input fields - this could be different cuisines or what to watch, as examples.

Then, go through the exercise until you reach your top choice.
